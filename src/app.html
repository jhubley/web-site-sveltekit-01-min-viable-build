			Because we do not use svelte.config.js to tell SvelteKit that
			the HTML ID "#svelte" is special, it's a little silly to put it here,
			but having a "wrapper" like this is pretty conventional
			once you start actually developing applications,
			so I included it.

			But SvelteKit will still compile an HTML page
			even if you don't include the DIV and put the "body" variable
			directly between HTML BODY tags.
